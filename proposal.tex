\section{Introduction}
According to the United Nations, urbanization is accelerating. In 2008, for the first time in humankind's history, more people lived in cities than did in rural areas. The number of people living in cities will only increase in the 21st century. To meet this challenge, urban planners are turning to "smart" solutions to the problems associated with modern cities. One such problem is that of traffic congestion. Congestion is strongly correlated to population density \cite{Manville2005}, and is thus only expected to increase with growing urbanization. A "smart" solution is to use increased connectivity of vehicles to improve individuals' paths through the traffic network. Particularly we focus on inter-vehicular communication, and how that can be used to improve traffic routing.
